### about me

I am an Assistant Physicist in the [Cosmological Physics & Advanced Computing Group](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/) at Argonne National Laboratory. I am also a member of the core dev team for [@conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge).

I study large-scale structure and cosmology using large-area sky surveys, weak gravitational lensing, machine learning, statistics, and supercomputers. I work on the [Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and am a member of the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) focused on data from the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/).
