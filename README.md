### about me

I am an Assistant Physicist in the [Cosmological Physics & Advanced Computing Group](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/cpac/) at Argonne National Laboratory. I am also a member of the core dev team for [@conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge).

I study large-scale structure and cosmology using large-area sky surveys, weak gravitational lensing, machine learning, statistics, and supercomputers. I work on the [Dark Energy Survey](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) and am a member of the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](http://www.lsst-desc.org/) focused on data from the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/).

### contact information

Dr. Matthew R. Becker

email: mrbecker [at] anl [dot] gov

### schedule and travel

It is easiest to reach me by email, but I can meet in person in the Chicagoland area.

### cv & publications

My CV is available [here](https://beckermr.github.io/images/cvpubs.pdf).

You can see all of my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IvmGG7gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0001-7774-2246&sort=date+desc).

### code & data

You can find all of my code here on GitHub or on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/beckermr/).

Some data is publicly available as well. Please contact me for access and conditions of use for these datasets.

#### Chinchilla N-body Simulation Set

This is a series of low- and high-resolution boxes with convergence tests. They are stored at SLAC [here](ttp://www.slac.stanford.edu/~beckermr/chinchilla/).

#### Cluster Shear and Convergence Fields

The shear and convergence fields around massive clusters from [Becker & Kravtsov (2011)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1681) are available [here](http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~beckermr/L1GpcAhaloweaklensingfields/).

### cosmoWidget

cosmoWidget is tool to calculate cosmological distances, times, E(z) factors, etc.
It also converts NFW halo definitions and computes N-body particle parameters.
Simply specify any flat or non-flat cosmology with the Dark Energy equation of state w
equal to minus one along with the redshift or scale factor. The integrations are done with
Simpson's rule with 10,000 points giving it an accuracy of approximately 1 kpc/h.
