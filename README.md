### about me

I am an Assistant Physicist in the Cosmological Physics & Advanced Computing Group at Argonne National Laboratory. I am also a member of the core dev team for @conda-forge.

Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Civis Analytics working on developing Civis's core technology. Before that, I was a postdoc in the Department of Physics and Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University and SLAC.

I study large-scale structure and cosmology using large-area sky surveys, weak gravitational lensing, machine learning, statistics, and supercomputers. I work on the Dark Energy Survey and am a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration focused on data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.
